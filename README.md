# To run the app on local machine 

- Download the zip folder or clone the repository
- Put your own API key value from <https://newsapi.org/> in the constants.js file
- Run **npm i** in the terminal  , the app should run successfully on localhost.

# Note -  

If you are trying to deploy the app on netlify or elsewhere it will not work since the CORS requests are not enabled by <https://newsapi.org/pricing> for basic developer plans although it will work fine on local machine.
