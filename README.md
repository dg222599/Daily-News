# DAILY - NEWS
- It is a news application which shows news articles from all over the world from some of the well known news sources.
- By default the app shows top-headlines of India on that day , however the user can view the news category wise for India.
- Also we can search for news items related to a specific items.
- We are using NEWS API -> <https://newsapi.org/> for fetching the news articles.

# To run the app on local machine 

- Download the zip folder or clone the repository
- Put your own API key value from <https://newsapi.org/> in the constants.js file
- Run **npm i** in the terminal  , the app should run successfully on localhost.

# Note -  

If you are trying to deploy the app on netlify or elsewhere it will not work since the CORS requests are not enabled by <https://newsapi.org/pricing> for basic developer plans although it will work fine on local machine.
